# Advent of code 2023 - STEP

This year, I'm goig to attempt to solve the Advent of Code 2023 in [STEP](https://github.com/ricardoboss/STEP).
It's a programming language I designed and implemented myself.

An interpreter for it is available in this directory: [./step.exe](./step.exe) (Windows x64 required, other downloads available in the repository).
